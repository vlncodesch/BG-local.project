    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SHORT DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;<strong>Dice</strong>&rdquo; is a unique table game adapted for betting with a wide selection of outcomes; it is unlike any other game in the world.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GAME PROCESS</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Five identical dice with sides numbered from 1 to 6 pips are used in the game. The presenter puts the dice into a dice box, shuffles and rolls them on the game table. Dice are rolled only once during a draw except in special cases when the roll has to be repeated. A roll is deemed to have taken place when all 5 dice stand on one of their sides and clearly make a five dice combination. The result of the draw is the 5 dice combination determined by the pip numbers on the top side of the dice after they are rolled on the table. The presenter names the lucky combination by non-changing rules.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is only one betting round and players can place their bets on all available outcomes for the upcoming draw. A betting round takes place between the game draws and lasts about four minutes. Draws of the game run every 5 minutes daily.</p>
