The Position or Positions with the highest ranking Hand win. A draw is possible in the game if more than one Position has the same highest Combination.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

The fourth round bets can be placed after the Turn (the fourth community card) is dealt face-up and odds are updated. Finally, the River (the fifth community card) is dealt and draw results are determined.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="text-align: justify;">In case of a draw, winnings are paid to all punters who placed bets on any of the winning Hands in any of the betting rounds.
