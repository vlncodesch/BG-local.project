    <p><strong>GAME RULES</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. Terms:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.1. Game machine &ndash; a mechanical device used to put, mix and randomly select the winning balls. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.2. Balls &ndash; a set of thirty six (36) balls which is used for the game. The balls are white, blue, green and red. There are 9 balls of each color and all balls are numbered from 1 to 36. Total sum of the numbers on the balls is 666. Total sum of the numbers on the white balls is 45, total sum of the numbers on the green balls is 126, total sum of the numbers on the red balls is 207 and total sum of the numbers on the blue balls is 288. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.3. Drum of the game machine &ndash; a part of the game machine where all the balls are placed after the presentation. Later the balls are mixed and the winning balls are drawn. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.4.&nbsp;<span style="text-indent: -0.01in;">Cylinders &ndash; 5 identical parts that are connected to the drum of the game machine where the winning balls are drawn. All 5 winning balls are shown in separate frame.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.5. Mixing and Selection process &ndash; a process that is considered as started when all balls fall into the Drum of the game machine. The process is considered as finished when all 5 winning balls are selected into the Cylinders and all the remaining balls lie at the bottom of the Drum of the game machine.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.6 Odds &ndash; numerical expression determined by the game organizer, which is multiplied by the amount of the player&rsquo;s stake to calculate the winnings. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1.&nbsp;<span style="text-indent: -0.01in;">5 winning balls out of 36 are randomly drawn to the cylinders of the game machine.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.2.&nbsp;<span style="text-indent: -0.01in;">The draw is deemed to have taken place when Mixing and Selection process is over. In all other cases the draw is either void and all the stakes are returned, or Mixing and Selection process is continued until 5 winning balls are selected into the Cylinders and all the remaining balls lie at the bottom of the Drum of the game machine.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.3.&nbsp;<span style="text-indent: -0.01in;">The order of the winning balls of the draw is determined by the machine cylinders from left to right. The cylinder to the left is considered to be first and the one on the right is the last. The order in which the cylinders are filled doesn&lsquo;t have any influence on the result of the draw.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
