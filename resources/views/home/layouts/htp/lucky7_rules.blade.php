    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SHORT DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;<strong>Lucky 7</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>7 out of 42</strong>&rdquo; is a dynamic game based on a lottery. Players are offered a wide range of betting outcomes and winning bets can return a profit which is two thousand times more than the stake.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GAME PROCESS</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">7 winning balls out of 42 are randomly drawn into the game tube. The draw is deemed to have taken place when at least 7 winning balls are selected. If more than 7 balls are placed in the tube, only the first 7 balls are counted and the other balls in the tube are ignored.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is only one betting round and players can place their bets on all available outcomes for the upcoming draw. A betting round takes place between the game draws and lasts about four minutes. Draws of the game run every 5 minutes daily.</p>
