    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SHORT DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;<strong>Bet-on-Baccarat</strong>&rdquo; is a real-time game with almost the same procedure and rules as Baccarat (or Punto Banco).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GAME PROCESS</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The game is played between two sides &ndash; the Player and the Banker. The dealer deals two cards face-up to each side in every draw of the game. Cards are dealt one at a time and the Player always receives the first card. In special situations the third card is dealt to the Player and (or) the Banker. The goal of the game is to collect a total sum of points as close as possible or equal to 9 (nine) after no more cards can be dealt according to the rules. A Tie occurs if the Player and the Banker have the same number of points.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The value of numerical cards from Deuce (2) to Nine (9) is equal to the number of points of the given card. The value of Face cards and Ten (10) is zero (0). Ace has a value of 1 (one) point. All card points are summed up to calculate the total sum of player&rsquo;s points. If the total sum is expressed in a double-digit figure, the score of the Player is the right digit of the total of the cards.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For example, the sum of Nine (9) and Four (4) is 13, so the score will be 3. The sum of Seven (7) and Eight (8) is 15, and the score will be 5.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">First round bets can be placed even before the opening of the first card. Punters can bet on one or more available outcomes. Second round bets can be placed when the Player receives the first card and odds are updated. Bets made in the previous betting round have no influence on later bets, therefore punters can place bets on the same or different outcomes more than once. Third round bets can be placed when the Banker receives the first card and odds update. After this betting round the Player and the Banker receive the second and, if necessary, the third card(cards). The results are calculated and the winner of the draw is displayed on screen.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In case of a Tie, punters who placed bets on this outcome are paid their winnings. Bets placed on the Player and (or) the Banker are void and punters get their stakes back (odds are equalised to one (1.00)).</p>

    <p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1. The game is played between two sides &ndash; the Player and the Banker. The dealer of the game deals two cards to each side in every draw of the game. In special situations the dealer deals the third card to the Player and (or) the Banker. The rules of dealing the third card are described in paragraph 2.6.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.2. Dealing:</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.2.1. Cards are dealt to sides by one card in turn until both sides have two cards face-up.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.2.2. The Player always receives the first card.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.2.3. When both sides have two cards face-up, the situation is assessed and in accordance with the fixed rules (see 2.6) it is determined whether the Player and (or) the Banker should receive the third card.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.3. The goal of the game is to collect a total of points as close as possible or equal to 9 (nine). The winner of the game is the side whose sum of points is closer to 9 (nine) after no more cards can be dealt according to the rules.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.3.1. Tie. A Tie occurs when the Player and the Banker have an equal sum of points. In the event of a Tie punters who placed bets on this outcome are paid their winnings. Bets placed on the Player and (or) the Banker are void and punters get their stakes back (odds are equalised to one (1.00)).</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4. Card value in points:</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.1. Ace has the value of 1 (one) point.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.2. The sum of points of numerical cards from Deuce (2) to Nine (9) is equal to the number of points of the given card.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.3. The value of Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) and Ten (10) is zero (0).</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.5. Calculation of the total of points:</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.5.1. All card points of each player are summed up to calculate the total sum of player&rsquo;s points.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.5.2. If the total sum is expressed in a double-digit figure, the score of the Player is the right digit of the total of cards. For example, the sum of Nine (9) and Four (4) is 13, so the score will be 3. The sum of Seven (7) and Eight (8) is 15, and the score will be 5.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.5.3. Additional bets:</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.5.3.1. In addition to the main bets like Player, Banker or Tie there are extra betting options such as bets on pairs and bets on the total of dealt cards. Odds for these outcomes change with each betting round.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.5.3.2. Bets on pairs (Player Pair, Banker Pair and Any Pair) apply only for the first two cards of the Player and Banker. The third card does not count and is not used to form pairs.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.5.3.3. Bets on the total of dealt cards can be placed as well. Bet on Small wins when the total of dealt cards is 4. Bet on Big wins when 5 or 6 cards are dealt.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.5.3.4. Additional bets are not linked with the main bets. It is possible to place the main bet on Player and additional bet on Banker Pair and vice versa. Additional bets can be placed without betting on the main bets.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.7. Exceptions to the Rules:</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.7.1. If Player or Banker is dealt 8 or 9 points in the first two cards, such hand is called a Natural hand, and no more cards are dealt. The total sums of the Player and the Banker points are calculated and the winner is announced. This rule supersedes all other rules.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.7.2. If Player is dealt 6 or 7 points in the first two cards, and Banker is dealt 5 points, or less (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) in the first two cards as well, then the Banker gets the third card.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Gameplay:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1. The first betting round. Bets can be placed even before the dealing of the first card. Punters can bet on one or more available outcomes.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3. The third betting round. After the second betting round the Banker receives the first card and new odds for the betting outcomes are displayed on screen and the third betting round begins.

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.5. The shuffling of cards. ; comes and shuffles the cards while everyone sees it and prepares the cards for dealing. Both shoes are visible on screen all the time so punters can see the shuffling and change of cards.</p>
